# Machine-Learning-Project

Machine Learning Project in the course “Machine Learning ML”. The project is from the module and represents 16 hours of sessions for 2ects. The course “Machine Learning” ML is currently for 4IF (4th year IT department) at INSA Lyon. The subject is in english but we can hand in an assignment in french (so we mix the two languages).

# Execution

**[commande1 blabla]**  # permet de blablabla1

**[commande2 blabla]**  # permet de blablabla2

# Instructions 

For each dataset: write a report in the form of an executable notebook either in R or **Python** (or even Julia)

- Explore the dataset: chapter 10 poly of course (”SVD et analyse d’un jeu de données”)
- Train different models : use for example: linear regression, ridge regression, kernel ridge regression, nyström approximation for kernel ridge regression. We have to consider at least one additional model (not introduced during the course). For example: random forest, multi-layers perceptron (explain parameters and hyper-parameters and how its hyper-parameters are related to the bias-variance tradeoff)

# Dataset

House Sales in King County, USA: This dataset contains information about house sales in King County, Washington, USA. It has 21613 instances and 21 attributes, including the price of each house. The task is to predict the price based on the other features. You can find this dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). This dataset is relatively large and clean. It has mostly numerical features that are easy to measure and interpret. The target variable (price) is also numerical and continuous.

# Team
