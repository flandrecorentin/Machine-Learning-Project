# Machine-Learning-Project

Machine Learning Project in the course “Machine Learning ML”. The project is from the module and represents 16 hours of sessions for 2ects. The course “Machine Learning” ML is currently for 4IF (4th year IT department) at INSA Lyon. The subject is in english but we can hand in an assignment in french (so we mix the two languages).

# Execution

**[commande1 blabla]**  # permet de blablabla1

**[commande2 blabla]**  # permet de blablabla2

# Instructions 

For each dataset: write a report in the form of an executable notebook either in R or **Python** (or even Julia)

- Explore the dataset: chapter 10 poly of course (”SVD et analyse d’un jeu de données”)
- Train different models : use for example: linear regression, ridge regression, kernel ridge regression, nyström approximation for kernel ridge regression. We have to consider at least one additional model (not introduced during the course). For example: random forest, multi-layers perceptron (explain parameters and hyper-parameters and how its hyper-parameters are related to the bias-variance tradeoff)
