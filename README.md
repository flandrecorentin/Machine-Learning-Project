# Machine-Learning-Project

Machine Learning Project in the course “Machine Learning ML”. The project is from the module and represents 16 hours of sessions for 2ects. The course “Machine Learning” ML is currently for 4IF (4th year IT department) at INSA Lyon. The subject is in english but we can hand in an assignment in french (so we mix the two languages).

**[commande2 blabla]**  # permet de blablabla2

# Instructions 

For each dataset: write a report in the form of an executable notebook either in R or **Python** (or even Julia)

- Explore the dataset: chapter 10 poly of course (”SVD et analyse d’un jeu de données”)
- Train different models : use for example: linear regression, ridge regression, kernel ridge regression, nyström approximation for kernel ridge regression. We have to consider at least one additional model (not introduced during the course). For example: random forest, multi-layers perceptron (explain parameters and hyper-parameters and how its hyper-parameters are related to the bias-variance tradeoff)

# Dataset

House Sales in King County, USA: This dataset contains information about house sales in King County, Washington, USA. It has 21613 instances and 21 attributes, including the price of each house. The task is to predict the price based on the other features. You can find this dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). This dataset is relatively large and clean. It has mostly numerical features that are easy to measure and interpret. The target variable (price) is also numerical and continuous.

# Dataset attributes

id - Unique ID for each home sold
date - Date of the home sale
price - Price of each home sold
bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
bathrooms - Number of bathrooms, where .5 accounts for a room with a toilet but no shower
sqft_living - Square footage of the apartments interior living space
sqft_lot - Square footage of the land space
floors - Number of floors
waterfront - A dummy variable for whether the apartment was overlooking the waterfront or not
view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was
condition - An index from 1 to 5 on the condition of the apartment,
grade - An index from 1 to 13, where 1-3 falls short of building construction and design, 7 has an average level of construction and design, and 11-13 have a high quality level of construction and design.
sqft_above - The square footage of the interior housing space that is above ground level
sqft_basement - The square footage of the interior housing space that is below ground level
yr_built - The year the house was initially built
yr_renovated - The year of the house’s last renovation
zipcode - What zipcode area the house is in
lat - Lattitude
long - Longitude
sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
